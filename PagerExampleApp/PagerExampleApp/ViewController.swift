                      Model(title: "Air Jordan IV", description: "This is the sneaker featured in the legendary scene in Do The Right Thing -- the movie that led to Spike Lee becoming Jordan's right-hand man in an unforgettable series of ads.", imageName: "IV"),
                      Model(title: "Air Jordan XII", description: "The sneaker that took the Jordan line from a Nike product to its own brand has held up remarkably well through the years, thanks in large part to its association with Michael's epic Flu Game.", imageName: "XII"),
                      Model(title: "Air Jordan V", description: "As a kid, I remember these more for Will Smith wearing them on The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air than for Michael wearing them on the court. Either way, they looked damn good.", imageName: "V"),
                      Model(title: "Air Jordan VII", description: "These were the shoes on Michael's feet when he played with the Dream Team in the 1992 Olympics. That itself would be worthy of a high ranking, but they also look and feel really good", imageName: "VII")]
